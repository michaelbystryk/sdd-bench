# Specification Quality Checklist: Postal-Code Validator + CLI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- The feature's behavioral rules are fully pinned by `reference/formats.md` and the existing test suite in `tests/`, so no clarification questions were needed.
- A minor "WHAT" tension exists: the API surface names (`validate`, `normalize`, `ValidationResult`, `--json`, exit codes) are part of the user-facing contract specified by the brief and `reference/formats.md`, so they are referenced as capabilities rather than treated as implementation leakage.
